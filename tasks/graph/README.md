# task

Molecular Property Prediction (Graph Property Prediction) on the ogbg-molhiv dataset. The task is to protect the target molecular properties as accurately as possible, i.e. wheter a molecule inhibits HIV virus replication or not

## dataset

[[ogb-molhiv](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/graphprop/#ogbg-mol)] is adapted from [MoleculeNet](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c7sc02664a)

nodes are atoms, and edges are chemical bonds, exact feature desciptions can be found in the [ogb code](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/blob/master/ogb/utils/features.py)
